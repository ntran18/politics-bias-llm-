Article Title: Emmanuel Macron to face Marine Le Pen in French presidential election runoff
Article Content: French President Emmanuel Macron will face Marine Le Pen in the second round of the country‚Äôs presidential election, setting up a rematch of their runoff contest in 2017. Centrist Macron and Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, were the top two candidates in the first round of Sunday‚Äôs vote, picking up 27.8% and 23.2% of the ballots respectively, according to the French Interior Ministry. Twelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24. The first round of the 2022 contest was marked by voter apathy, with participation estimated at 73.3%, according to an analysis by pollster Ifop-Fiducial for French broadcasters TF1 and LCI ‚Äì the lowest in a first round in 20 years. While Macron received more votes than any of the other candidates in the first round, he is a polarizing figure whose approval rating has sagged during his first term. In a speech after polls closed on Sunday, he urged citizens to vote in the second round. ‚ÄúNothing is settled and the debate that we will have in the coming 15 days is decisive for our country and our Europe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a France which, having left Europe, would have as its only allies the international populists and xenophobes. That is not us. I want a France faithful to humanism, to the spirit of enlightenment,‚Äù he said. Macron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. Polls have given him a consistent edge over the rest of the field, but the race has tightened significantly in the past month. Polling by Ifop-Fiducial released on Sunday showed that Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%. Le Pen‚Äôs support has steadily risen in recent weeks. Though she is best known for her far-right policies such as drastically restricting immigration and banning Muslim headscarves in public places, she has run a more mainstream campaign this time around, softening her language and focusing more on pocketbook issues like the rising cost of living, a top concern for the French electorate. In her speech Sunday, Le Pen vowed to be a president for ‚Äúall the French‚Äù if she wins the second round, and called on those who didn‚Äôt vote for Macron to support her in the second round. Leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came third, with 22% of the vote. He enjoyed a late surge in support and was considered a possible dark horse candidate to challenge Macron. Who Melenchon‚Äôs voters choose to back in the second round could decide the presidency, experts say. Melenchon told his supporters that ‚Äúwe must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,‚Äù but did not explicitly back Macron. No other candidate received more than 10% of the votes. Far-right political commentator turned presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to Ifop polling, came in fourth at 7.1%. The other candidates on Sunday‚Äôs ballot have quickly begun throwing their weight behind the top two. While Zemmour called on his backers to vote for Le Pen, the others urged their supporters to steer clear of her. The candidates from the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, have already backed Macron. Socialist Anne Hidalgo said a Le Pen victory would instill in France ‚Äúa hatred of everyone set against everyone,‚Äù while Republican Valerie Pecresse said she was sincerely worried for the country because ‚Äúthe far right has never been so close to winning.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe project of Marine Le Pen will open France to discord, impotence, and collapse,‚Äù said Pecresse. Macron‚Äôs political rise shattered the playing field, as his centrist political party has pulled supporters away from the traditional centrist parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Both its candidates polled under 5% on Sunday. Surveys ahead of the race showed that a second round of Macron vs. Le Pen was the most likely outcome. Macron handily beat Le Pen five years ago, but experts have said that a second contest between the two would be much tighter than the 2017 race. Macron is no longer a political upstart and must run on a mixed record. While his ambitious plan to bolster the European Union‚Äôs autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, he remains a divisive figure when it comes to domestic policies. His handling of the yellow vest movement, one of France‚Äôs most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive. Macron‚Äôs signature policy during the crisis ‚Äì requiring people to show proof of vaccination to go about their lives as normal ‚Äì helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency. Macron has, so far, done very little campaigning. Experts believe his strategy was to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Polling showed him consistently leading all candidates, and he was considered a shoo-in to make the second round. ‚ÄúThe widespread dissatisfaction with Macron (especially among the young) means that the outcome is uncertain and unpredictable. Le Pen will continue to exploit this, and a major political upset therefore remains possible,‚Äù said CNN European affairs commentator Dominic Thomas of the second round matchup. ‚ÄúHowever much they may dislike Le Pen, there is a world of difference between her and Macron, and how she would disrupt European and global politics.‚Äù Le Pen is the daughter of another famous far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The elder Le Pen made it to the runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Marine Le Pen has managed to perform better than her father in the first round of each of the past two presidential elections. Le Pen has tried to portray herself as a very different candidate to the one who lost to Macron in 2017, when she attempted to position herself to the forgotten French working classes as her country‚Äôs answer to then-US President Donald Trump. While her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, euroskepticism and positions on Islam in France are unchanged, Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal. The contest was at first predicted to be a referendum on the dominance of the extreme right in French politics, but the war in Ukraine ‚Äì another key issue for voters ‚Äì upended the race. According to Ifop polling, Macron‚Äôs support peaked in early March, as potential voters rallied around the flag and rewarded the president for his attempts to mediate the conflict in Ukraine before Russia‚Äôs invasion, even if it was a failure. Many experts also expected the war to hurt the Le Pen, who had been a vocal admirer of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who has become a pariah in the West due to the Kremlin‚Äôs decision to invade Ukraine in late February. Le Pen visited the Russian president during her 2017 campaign; this time around, she was forced to scrap a leaflet with a photo of her and Putin from that trip after Russia‚Äôs unprovoked attack on its neighbor. Thomas, the CNN European affairs commentator, explained that the forthcoming debates will be crucial if Macron is to convince voters that Le Pen‚Äôs previous support for Putin should disqualify her. ‚ÄúHe will be vulnerable on a range of domestic issues, but she will have difficulty convincing the electorate of her foreign policy credentials, especially given her longstanding links with Russia,‚Äù he said.

Wake Forest University Medical School is standing by a student who suggested she intentionally harmed one of her patients for disagreeing with her about transgender ideology. The student, fourth-year Kychelle Del Rosario, came under fire after appearing to boast about the incident on Twitter in late March. The university responded with a brief suspension but announced no further consequences in its latest statement. Del Rosario tweeted: ""I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff ‘She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there?’ I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice."" The university publicly responded to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, saying Del Rosario's tweet was not an accurate recounting of the incident. ""Our documentation verifies that after the student physician was unsuccessful in obtaining the blood draw, the student appropriately deferred a second attempt to one of our certified professionals. The student did not attempt to draw blood again,"" the school wrote. ETHICS PROFESSOR SLAMS MEDICAL STUDENT WHO IMPLIED SHE STUCK A PATIENT FOR MOCKING HER PRONOUN PIN The university's statement included a lengthy apology letter from Del Rosario, in which she claims she never intended to harm the individual, blaming the missed vein on inexperience. ""For the event mentioned in the tweet, I was performing a blood draw on a patient and during our conversation they had shown dismay at my pronoun pin,"" Del Rosario wrote, according to the university newspaper. ""I calmly shared my thoughts about pronouns and did not escalate the situation further. When I was doing the blood draw, I missed the first time due to my inexperience as a student, and per our policy, my supervisor performed the successful blood draw the second time. During this encounter, I never intended to harm the patient."" ""I am truly sorry for poorly representing our school and our health system. I will reflect on responsible social media use as a professional and my duty to care for all my patients, regardless of any differences of belief,"" she concluded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Del Rosario's actions led to heavy criticism on social media, many of her fellow Wake Forest students jumped to defend her. One op-ed published in the school's newspaper was titled ""Criticism of Wake Forest medical student is excessive."" ""The crux of the issue at hand is not the conduct of Del Rosario, but the bigotry expressed by her patient,"" claimed the author, opinions editor and sophomore Sophie Guymon. ""It is appalling that the vast majority of the media coverage surrounding Del Rosario’s tweet is critiquing her lack of professionalism rather than her patient’s display of bigotry.""

Article Title: Will Smith banned from Oscars for 10 years over slap
Article Content: Will Smith (R) hit Chris Rock on stage during the Oscars ceremony, after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars gala and other Academy events for 10 years after the US actor slapped comic Chris Rock at the ceremony. In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been ""overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behaviour we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage"". Smith has apologised for his actions and resigned from the Academy. The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife's shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia. Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in King Richard, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action. In a statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and ""restoring trust in the Academy"". The Academy said that directly after the slap it did not ""adequately address the situation in the room"" and had been ""unprepared for the unprecedented"". It apologised for this. It also thanked Rock for ""maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances"". In his resignation statement, Smith said he had ""betrayed the trust of the Academy"" and was ""heartbroken"" over his actions. He added he would ""fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct"". Smith's resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars. The Academy's disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after he resigned. Few have ever stepped down from the Academy. Four members - producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski and cinematographer Adam Kimmel - have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him. But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards or taking back his newly won Oscar. Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called Young Americans won the best documentary honour in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year. Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg - a member of the Academy's board of governors - predicted Smith would face ""big consequences"" but said ""we're not going to take that Oscar away from him."" Beyond the Academy's actions, at least two studios - Sony and Netflix - are pausing their projects with Smith. Rock, who began his latest stand up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap. He told fans at a show last month that he is ""still kind of processing what happened"" and will talk about the incident ""at some point"".
